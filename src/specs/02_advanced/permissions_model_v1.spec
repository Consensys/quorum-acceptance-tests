# Enhanced Basic(v1) Permissions Model

 Tags: networks/template::raft-3plus1, pre-condition/no-record-blocknumber, permissions-v1

The Enhanced Permissions Model caters for enterprise-level needs by having a smart contract-based permissioning model.
This allows for significant flexibility to manage nodes, accounts, and account-level access controls.

The test scenarios are based on the following setup:

      |id        |networkType      |permissionVersion |qip714block |
      |r1        |permissioned     |v1                |20          |

* Start permission network <networkType> <permissionVersion> <id> <qip714block>

//## Network Admin Organization and Role are initialized successfully

//
//Network Admin Organization is the name of initial organization that will be created as a part of network boot up with new permissions model.
//This organization will own all the initial nodes which come at the time of network boot up and accounts
//which will be the network admin account.
//
//Network Admin Role will have full access and will be network admin.
//This role will be assigned to the network admin accounts
//* Validate network admin role and basic testing

## Proposing a new organization into the network

// Tags: post-condition/datadir-cleanup, post-condition/network-cleanup

Once the network is up, the network admin accounts can then propose a new organization into the network.
Majority approval from the network admin accounts is required before an organization is approved.

* Propose new organization to the network <permissionVersion> <id>

//## Suspending an organization temporarily
//
// Tags: post-condition/datadir-cleanup, post-condition/network-cleanup
//
//The network admin accounts can suspend/revoke-suspension all activities (e.g.: transaction processing)
//of an organization and will require majority voting.
//
//* Suspend an org <permissionVersion> <id>
//
//## Deactivating an organization to stop block synchronization in a node
