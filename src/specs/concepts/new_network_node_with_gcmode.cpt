# Blocks are synced when adding new node <nodeName> with <gcmode> `gcmode` to network <networkName> as <nodeType>

* Send some transactions to create blocks in network <networkName> and capture the latest block height as "latestBlockHeight"
* Add new node with <gcmode> `gcmode`, named it <nodeName>, and join the network <networkName> as <nodeType>
* Wait for node <nodeName> to catch up to "latestBlockHeight"
* Verify node <nodeName> has the block height greater or equal to "latestBlockHeight"
