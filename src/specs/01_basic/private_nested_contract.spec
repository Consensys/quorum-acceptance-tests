# Nested private smart contracts

 Tags: basic, privacy, nested

This is to verify that nested private smart contracts between 2 parties are not accessible by others.

A simple smart contract is to store a int value and to provide `get()` and `set()` functions.
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract C1 {

   uint x;

   function set(uint newValue) public returns (uint) {
       x = newValue;
       return x;
   }

   function get() public view returns (uint) {
       return x;
   }
}

contract C2  {

   C1 c1;

   constructor(address _t) public {
       c1 = C1(_t);
   }

   function get() public view returns (uint result) {
       return c1.get();
   }

   function set(uint _val) public {
       c1.set(_val);
   }

}
```

* Deploy a C1 contract with initial value "42" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contractC1_1"
* Deploy a C2 contract with initial value "contractC1_1" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contractC2_1"

## Contracts are deployed successfully

 Tags: private, mining

* "contractC1_1" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"
* "contractC2_1" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"

## Privacy is enforced between parties

 Tags: private

* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "42"
* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "42"
* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node3" returns "0"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "42"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "42"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node3" returns "0"

## When there's an update, privacy is still enforced

 Tags: private

* Execute contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `set()` function with new value "5" in "Node1" and it's private for "Node4"
* Record the current block number, named it as "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "5"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "5"
* Wait for node "Node4" to catch up to "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "5"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "5"
* Wait for node "Node3" to catch up to "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* Contract `C1`("contractC1_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node3" returns "0"
* Contract `C2`("contractC2_1")'s `get()` function execution in "Node3" returns "0"
