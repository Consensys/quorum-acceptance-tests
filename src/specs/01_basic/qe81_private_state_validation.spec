# Support Private State Validation in a private smart contract

 Tags: privacy, private-state-validation, privacy-enhancements, qe81

For simplicity, Private State Validation is abbreviated to PSV through out the specification.

PSV is to make sure all participants only apply transactions which result in the same new state.

At the time or writing, the solution is feasible only when list of participants is shared.
Hence PSV is not enabled by default, it's configurable per contract and
being passed via `sendTransaction` RPC call from client.

Limitations:
 - Byzantine party sender would decide not to send data to one of the participant causing this participant's state
   out of sync with others
 - In a situation when concurrent transactions affecting PSV contract, only the first transaction would be successfully applied.
   Others would have failure in their receipts

There are 2 set of contracts to be used selectively in the below scenarios.

Single smart contract
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint private storedData;

    constructor(uint initVal) public {
        storedData = initVal;
    }

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public constant returns (uint retVal) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

Nested smart contracts
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract C1 {

   uint x;

   function set(uint newValue) public returns (uint) {
       x = newValue;
       return x;
   }

   function get() public view returns (uint) {
       return x;
   }
}

contract C2  {

   C1 c1;
   uint y;

   constructor(address _t) public {
       c1 = C1(_t);
   }

   function get() public view returns (uint result) {
       return c1.get();
   }

   function set(uint _val) public {
       y = _val;
       c1.set(_val);
   }

   function restoreFromC1() public {
       y = c1.get();
   }
}
```

## Private State is validated in all participants

 Tags: validation

We can't really verify the if participants actually validated their states. Assuming they did, their state should return the same value

* Deploy a "StateValidation" contract `SimpleStorage` with initial value "40" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contract14"
* "contract14" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"
* "contract14"'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "40"
* "contract14"'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "40"


## Transactions sent to simple contract by non-psv node without flag will result in mismatched receipts

 Tags: single

* Deploy a "StateValidation" simple smart contract with initial value "42" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contract14"
* "contract14" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"
* Fire and forget execution of simple contract("contract14")'s `set()` function with new arbitrary value in "Node3" and it's private for "Node1"
* Transaction Receipt is "unsuccessfully" available in "Node1" for "contract14"
* Transaction Receipt is "successfully" available in "Node3" for "contract14"
* Transaction Receipt is "successfully" available in "Node4" for "contract14"

## Privacy is maintained when non-psv node trying to send a transaction to a simple contract without flag

 Tags: single

Transactions, regardless if it succeeds or not, sent by non-party node must not change the private states of the participants

* Deploy a "StateValidation" simple smart contract with initial value "42" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contract14"
* "contract14" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"
* Fire and forget execution of simple contract("contract14")'s `set()` function with new arbitrary value in "Node3" and it's private for "Node1"
* "contract14"'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "42"
* "contract14"'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "42"
* "contract14"'s `get()` function execution in "Node3" returns "0"

## Deny transactions that are sent to a non-PSV nested contract executing a function in a PSV parent contract

 Tags: nested

C1 is PSV contract and C2 is not. Transactions to C2 that impacts C1 are not allowed -> nested flag mismatch
1st failure = flag mismatch on C1
2nd failure = privacyMetadata not found for C2

* Deploy a "StateValidation" contract `C1` with initial value "42" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contractC1_14"

* Deploy a "StandardPrivate" contract `C2` with initial value "contractC1_14" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contractC2_14"
* "contractC2_14" is deployed "successfully" in "Node1,Node4"
* Fail to execute "StandardPrivate" contract `C2`("contractC2_14")'s `set()` function with new arbitrary value in "Node1" and it's private for "Node4" with error "sent privacy flag doesn't match all affected contract flags"
* Fail to execute "StateValidation" contract `C2`("contractC2_14")'s `set()` function with new arbitrary value in "Node1" and it's private for "Node4" with error "PrivacyMetadata not found"

C1 is PSV contract and C2 is not. Transactions to C2 that reads from C1 and updates C2 are not allowed -> nested flag mismatch
