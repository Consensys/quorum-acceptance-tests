# Storage Master - exercise parent child relationships including creating two children from parent with a single transaction (privacy enhancements)

 Tags: privacy-enhancements

This is to verify that a SimpleStorage smart contract created via a parent StorageMaster works as expected when used in
both PartyProtection and StateValidation transactions. Executing the createSimpleStorageC2C3 method results in two
(child) contracts having the same ACOTH. The setC2C3Value method then affects both child contracts but since they both
have the same ACOTH only one transaction hash is forwarded to tessera.
This scenario helps justify relaxing the ACOTH checks in state transition (removing the logic that verifies the actual
affected contracts counter is equal to length of the received privacy metadata ACHashes array).
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint private storedData;

    constructor(uint initVal) public {
        storedData = initVal;
    }

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public constant returns (uint retVal) {
        return storedData;
    }
}

contract StorageMaster {
    event contractCreated(address _addr);

    SimpleStorage public c;
    SimpleStorage public c2;
    SimpleStorage public c3;

    function createSimpleStorage(uint initVal) public {
        c = new SimpleStorage(initVal);
        emit contractCreated(address(c));
    }

    function createSimpleStorageC2C3(uint initVal) public {
        c2 = new SimpleStorage(initVal);
        emit contractCreated(address(c2));
        c3 = new SimpleStorage(initVal);
        emit contractCreated(address(c3));
    }

    function setC2C3Value(uint val) public{
        c2.set(val);
        c3.set(val);
    }

    function getC2C3Value() public view returns (uint){
        return c2.get() + c3.get();
    }
}
```

  This spec will be executed for PartyProtection and StateValidation privacy flag values

## Deploy a private storage master and create a simple storage contract from it

 Tags: parent-child

* Deploy a <privacyType> storage master contract in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "smPrivate1"

* Transaction Hash is returned for "smPrivate1"
* Transaction Receipt is present in "Node1" for "smPrivate1" from "Node1"'s default account
* Deploy a <privacyType> simple storage from master storage contract "smPrivate1" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "ssPrivate1"
* "ssPrivate1"'s `get()` function execution in "Node1" returns "10"
* "ssPrivate1"'s `get()` function execution in "Node2" returns "0"
* "ssPrivate1"'s `get()` function execution in "Node4" returns "10"

## Deploy a private storage master and create two simple storage contracts from it with a single transaction

  Tags: parent-child

* Deploy a <privacyType> storage master contract in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "smPrivate2"

* Transaction Hash is returned for "smPrivate2"
* Transaction Receipt is present in "Node1" for "smPrivate2" from "Node1"'s default account
* Deploy a <privacyType> simple storage C2C3 with value "5" from master storage contract "smPrivate2" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4"
the two resulting contracts have the same transaction as their ACOTH
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node1" returns "10"
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node2" returns "0"
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node4" returns "10"
* Invoke a <privacyType> setC2C3Value with value "15" in master storage contract "smPrivate2" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4"
* Record the current block number, named it as "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node1" returns "30"
* Wait for node "Node2" to catch up to "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node2" returns "0"
* Wait for node "Node3" to catch up to "blockHeightAfterValueIsUpdated"
* "smPrivate2"'s `getC2C3Value()` function execution in "Node4" returns "30"
